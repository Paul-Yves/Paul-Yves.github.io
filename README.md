# FengShui2_FightTracker2

A small front-end web app to track foes in a fengshui2 game. It offers basic features to create a list of featured foes (or boss...) and mooks, follow most of their stats and above all, make them use shots to roll AVs (you can even group mooks roll, adding their number to their AV). The application also come with a sequence and shot counter, sorting the foes and coloring them depending on the current shot and theirs. No save mechanisme for now.

To use this application, just download the whole source code (in a zip), and open index.html with your favourite web browser.
